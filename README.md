# Elbrus Coding BootCamp 
## Code Review Generator

Made to easy the use of generating code reviews for students. I find it quite difficult to use the current code review generator, so a decision to make sum changes was made. Furthermore, I would like to point out that this is just the beginning of the backend, and there is still many more things to do.
